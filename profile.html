                <p>PUP is a public, non-sectarian, non-profit institution of higher learning primarily tasked with harnessing the tremendous human resources potential of the nation by improving the physical, intellectual and material well-being of the individual through higher occupational, technical and professional instruction and training in the applied arts and sciences related to the fields of commerce, business administration, and technology. PUP operates year-round with two semesters and a summer. Summer sessions depend on the course and on the campus. Majority of the students belong to the economically challenged level of society. It is the University's commitment to give qualified and talented students access to quality and responsive education to aid them in the achievement of their dreams and improve their lives. Being a well-educated and skilled individual, they will not only become job seekers but job creators as well, a force of knowledge workers and entrepreneurs.</p>

                    <p>Scholars of the Nation (Iskolar ng Bayan), that is what we call our students because the Philippine Government and other non-government institutions subsidize their tuition and other fees. They are enrolled in business, language, statistics, communication, and education courses in the undergraduate and graduate levels. The commitment of the leaders, faculty, staff, students, alumni and friends has formed the cornerstone of this University that has exceeded expectations with every generation of the graduates it has produced since its establishment.
                    Today, PUP is relishing its successes and its students are enjoying unprecedented academic opportunities, an enhanced campus environment, upgraded colleges, state-of-the-art technology, and nationally and internationally recognized programs. PUP Santa Rosa Branch celebrated its 21<sup>st</sup> founding anniversary last February 12, 2024. It has gone far from what it was more than a decade ago. This is mainly due to the support given by the government and the PUP Community and its benefactors. With the combined effort, PUP will continue to be a partner in nation-building and in poverty alleviation for the marginalized sector of society with quality, responsive, and relevant education as a tool.</p>
