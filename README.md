# PUPSRB-Static-Webpage

It is my simple HTML, CSS and one-page static site with a slow loading time intended as a first semester project when I was a first-year student at Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Sta. Rosa Branch. It presents the raw data of the campus and was created to study and use my core web development abilities. The project highlights essential school information including its background, academic offerings, student services, and contact details.
